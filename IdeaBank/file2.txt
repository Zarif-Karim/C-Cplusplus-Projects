Recording videos with Laptop camera
computer
laptop
camera

Have you ever tried to record a video with a laptop or a front facing camera (all in one desktop) of a subject other than yourself. It is not easy, so it would be very productive to have a rear built in camera so that the user could just sit at the desktop monitor as normal and record the subject that is in front. It would be nice if the camera could change directions as well.
