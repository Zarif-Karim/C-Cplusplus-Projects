First input 'From' and second input 'To' are names of cities from the map.jpg file in the root folder of this project.

The program takes source and destination input and outputs the shortest path to travel from the source node to the destination node.
The program uses BFS to update the graph space to hold the cumulative shortest path from the root to destination, then using the destination('To') city name to travel back to the starting point.
